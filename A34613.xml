            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lord, theſe were the inducements which ſet me upon this attempt, it being the ſubject of the Book, to clear and aſſert an important truth, which is as a Criterion whereby to know the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from her Adverſaries on both hands, thoſe that adore, and thoſe that profane the bleſſed Sacrament; theſe that deſtroy the viſible Sign, and thoſe that deny the inviſible Grace: I thought I might juſtly offer it to ſo pious and ſo great a Son of this Church, who own'd

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now nineteen years ſince this Hiſtorical Treatiſe was made by the Right Reverend Father in God <hi>John Coſin,</hi> when (in the time of the late accurſed Rebellion) he was an Exile in <hi>Paris</hi> for his Loyalty and Religion's ſake; for being then commanded to remain in that City by his gracious Majeſty that now is, (who was departing into <hi>Germany</hi> by reaſon of a League newly made by the <hi>French</hi> King with our wicked Rebels) he was alſo ordered by him, as he had been before by his bleſſed Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, a Prince never enough to be commended, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Divine Offices in the Royal Chappel, and to endeavour to keep and confirm in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang,</hi> his fellow-Exiles, both of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and others his Country-men who then lived
<pb facs="tcp:41401:7"/>in that place. Now the occaſion of his writing this Piece was this: When his Gracious Majeſty had choſen <hi>Colen</hi> for the place of his reſidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly invited, he viſited a neighbouring Potent Prince of the Empire, of the Roman Perſwaſion; where it fell out, as it doth uſually where Perſons of different Religions do meet; ſome Jeſuits began to diſcourſe of Controverſies with thoſe Noblemen and Worthies, (who never forſook their Prince in his greateſt ſtraights, but were his conſtant Attendants, and Imitators of his ever conſtant Profeſſion of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) charging the Church of <hi>England</hi> with Hereſie, eſpecially in what concerns the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper. They would have it, that our Church holds no real, but only a kind of imaginary preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retained ſtill the very ſame faith concerning this ſacred Myſtery, which the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained in all Ages; to wit, that the whole ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is changed into the ſubſtance of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and right-well called Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> This, and much more to the ſame purpoſe was pronounced by the Jeſuits, in preſence of His Majeſty and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Prince, with as much poſitiveneſs and confidence, as if it had been a clear and ſelf-evident truth owned by all the Learned.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41401:7"/>
            <p>His Sacred Majeſty, and his Noble Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants knew well enough that the Jeſuits did ſhameleſly belie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that their brags about Roman Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation were equally falſe and vain: But the German Prince having recommended to the peruſal of thoſe Honourable Perſons that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King a Manuſcript wherein (as he ſaid) was proved by Authentick Authors all that had been advanced by the Jeſuits. They thought it fit to acquaint the Reverend Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> with the whole buſineſs, and intreat him that he would vindicate the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Calumny, and plainly declare what is her avowed Doctrine and belief about the true and real Preſence of Chriſt in the Bleſſed Sacrament. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our worthy Doctor, who was ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and zealous to do good, eſpecially when it might benefit the Church of God, fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to work, and writ this excellent Treatiſe as an Anſwer to the Prince's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, that if thoſe worthy Perſons plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they might repay his Highneſs kindneſs in kind: Yet notwithſtanding the ſolicitations of thoſe that occaſioned it, and of others that had peruſed it, he would not yield to have it made publick while a few months before he died; becauſe having compoſed it for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, he thought it ſufficient, that
<pb facs="tcp:41401:8"/>it had been uſeful to them. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about the Preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, being of late years reſumed with much vigour, and even now famous by the learned and eloquent Diſputes of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> Miniſter of the Reformed Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Arnold</hi> Doctor of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and others, who moved by their example, have entred the Liſts. The reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and more earneſt importunities of his friends obtained at laſt his conſent for the publication of this Work; and the rather, becauſe he thought that the Error conſtantly maintained by the famous Doctor of <hi>Sorbon</hi> was by a lucky anticipation clearly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted throughout this Book, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Fathers have ſaid about the true and real Preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, that ſtout <hi>Roman</hi> Champion applies to his Tranſubſtantiation, and then crows over his Adverſaries ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he hath utterly overthrown the Proteſtants cauſe; whereas there is ſuch a wide difference, as may be called <hi>a great Gulf fixed</hi> betwixt the true or real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Lords Supper, and the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread and Wine into his Body and Bloud. This laſt is ſuch a Prodigie as is neither taught by Scripture, nor poſſible to be apprehended by faith; it is
<pb facs="tcp:41401:8"/>repugnant to right reaſon, and contrary to ſenſe; and is no where to be found in Ancient Writers: But the other is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, and to the Analogy of faith; it is not againſt Reaſon, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual it cannot be perceived by our bodily ſenſes, and it is back'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unanimous Doctrine of the holy Fathers. For it makes nothing againſt it, that ſometimes the ſame Fathers do ſpeak of the Bread and Wine of the holy Euchariſt as of the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a manner of ſpeech very proper and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in ſpeaking of Sacraments to give to the ſign the name of the thing ſignified: And however they explain themſelves in other places, when they frequently enough call the Sacramental Bread and Wine Types, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, Figures, and Signs of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; thereby declaring openly for us againſt the Maintainers of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. For we may ſafely, without any prejudice to our Tenet uſe thoſe Expreſſions of the Ancients which the Papiſts think to be moſt favourable to them, taking them in a Sacramental ſenſe, as they ought to be; whereas, the laſt mentioned, that are againſt them, none can uſe, but by ſo doing he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſtroys the whole contrivance of Tranſubſtantiation, it being altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb facs="tcp:41401:9"/>to ſay, the Bread is ſubſtantially changed into the Body of Chriſt, and the Bread is a Figure, a Sign, and a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Body of Chriſt. For, what hath loſt its being can in no wiſe ſignifie, or repreſent any other thing: Neither was ever any thing ſaid to repreſent and be the Figure and Sign of it ſelf. But this is more at large treated of in the Book it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now having given an account of the occaſion of writing and publiſhing this Diſcourſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Reader will expect that I ſhould ſay ſomething of its excellent Author: But ſhould I now undertake to ſpeak but of the moſt memorable things that concern this great Man, my thoughts would be overwhelmed with their multitude, and I muſt be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both to him and my Readers, being confined within the narrow limits of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. But what cannot be done here may be done ſomewhere elſe, God willing. This only I would not have the Reader to be ignorant of, That this Learned man and (as appears by this) conſtant Profeſſor and Defendor of the Proteſtant Religion was one of thoſe who was moſt vehemently accuſed of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Presbyterians before the late Wars, and for that reaſon bitterly perſecuted by them, and forced to forſake his Country; whereby he ſecured himſelf from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:41401:9"/>of their Hands, but not of their Tongues; for ſtill the good men kept up the noiſe of their clamorous Accuſation even while he was writing this moſt ſubſtantial Treatiſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Real, that is, true and not imaginary Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is proved by Scripture. <hi>2</hi> and <hi>3.</hi> Yet this favours not the Tenet of Tranſubſtantiation, being it is not to be underſtood groſly and carnally, but ſpiritually and Sacramentally. <hi>4.</hi> The nature and uſe of the Sacraments. <hi>5.</hi> By means of the Elements of Bread and Wine, Chriſt himſelf is ſpiritually eaten by the Faithful in the Sacrament. <hi>6.</hi> The eating and preſence being ſpiritual are not deſtructive of the truth and ſubſtance of the thing. <hi>7.</hi> The manner of Preſence is unſearchable, and ought not to be preſumptuouſly defined.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe words which our bleſſed Saviour uſed in the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26. Luk. 22.19.</note> 
               <hi>This is my body which is given for you; This is my bloud which is ſhed for you, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41401:11"/>are held and acknowledged by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church to be moſt true and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And if any one dares oppoſe them, or call in queſtion Chriſts Veracity, or the truth of his words, or refuſe to yield his ſincere aſſent to them, except he be allowed to make a meer figment or a bare figure of them,<note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>G. Calixtus</hi> writes in ſome place of his learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitations; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him <hi>M. Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, in Exam. Con. Trid. atque in locis Theol.</hi>
               </note> we cannot, and ought not, either excuſe or ſuffer him in our Churches; for we muſt embrace and hold for an undoubted truth whatever is taught by Divine Scripture. And therefore we can as little doubt of what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55 <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed;</hi> which, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are both given to us by the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For he calls the Bread, <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſts Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> and the Cup, <hi>the Communion of his bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is moſt evident that the Bread and Wine (which according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> are the Elements of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt) are neither changed as to their ſubſtance, nor vaniſht, nor reduc'd to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but are ſolemnly conſecrated by the words of Chriſt, that by them his bleſſed body and bloud may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41401:11"/>
            <p n="3">3. And further it appears from the ſame words, that the expreſſion of Chriſt and the Apoſtle, is to be underſtood in a Sacramental and myſtick ſenſe; and that no groſs and carnal preſence of body and bloud can be maintained by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And though the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> be no where uſed in Scripture to ſignifie the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Euchariſt, yet the Chriſtian Church, ever ſince its Primitive ages, hath given it that name, and always called the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body and bloud therein, Myſtick and Sacramental. Now a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental expreſſion doth, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, give to the ſign the name of the thing ſignified:<note place="margin">Exod. 12.21. 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note> And ſuch is as well the uſual way of ſpeaking, as the nature of Sacraments, that not only the names, but even the properties and effects of what they repreſent and exhibite, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the outward Elements. Hence (as I ſaid before) the Bread is as clearly as poſitively called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This alſo ſeems very plain, that our Bleſſed Saviour's deſign was not ſo much to teach, what the Elements of Bread and Wine are by nature and ſubſtance, as what is their uſe and office and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this Myſtery: For the body and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41401:12"/>bloud of our Saviour are not only fitly repreſented by the Elements, but alſo, by vertue of his inſtitution really offered to all, by them, and ſo eaten by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Myſtically and Sacramentally; whence it is,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.56.</note> that <hi>he truly is and abides in us, and we in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This is the ſpiritual (and yet no leſs true and undoubted than if it were corporal) eating of Chriſt's fleſh, not indeed ſimply as it is fleſh, without any other reſpect (for ſo it is not given, neither would it profit us) but as it is crucified and <hi>given</hi> for the redemption of the world;<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note> neither doth it hinder the truth and ſubſtance of the thing, that this eating of Chriſt's body is ſpiritual, and that by it the ſouls of the Faithful, and not their ſtomachs, are fed by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt: For this none can deny, but they who being ſtrangers to the Spirit and the divine vertue, can favour only carnal things, and to whom, what is Spiritual and Sacramental, is the ſame as if a meer nothing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the manner of the preſence of the body and bloud of our Lord in the Bleſſed Sacrament, we that are Proteſtant and Reformed according to the ancient Catholick Church, do not ſearch into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41401:12"/>the manner of it with perplexing inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but, after the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pureſt Church of Chriſt, we leave it to the power and wiſdom of our Lord, yielding a full and unfeined aſſent to his words: Had the Romiſh main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Tranſubſtantiation done the ſame, they would not have determined and decreed, and then impoſed as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a manner of preſence, newly by them invented, under pain of the moſt direful Curſe, and there would have been in the Church leſs wrangling, and more peace and unity than now is.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1, 2,</hi> and <hi>3, &amp;c.</hi> The unanimous conſent of all Proteſtants with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in maintaining a real, that is, true, but not a carnal preſence of Chriſt in the Bleſſed Sacrament, proved by publick Confeſsions and the beſt of Authorities.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. SO then, none of the Proteſtant Churches doubt of the real (that is, true and not imaginary) Preſence of Chriſt's body and bloud in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there appears no reaſon why any man ſhould ſuſpect their common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of either fraud or error, as though in this particular they had in the leaſt departed from the Catholick faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For it is eaſie to produce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Reformed Churches and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whereby it will clearly appear (to them that are not wilfully blind) that they all zealouſly maintain and profeſs this truth, without forſaking in any wiſe the true Catholick Faith in this matter.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41401:13"/>
            <p n="3">3. I begin with the <hi>Church of England;</hi> wherein they that are in holy Orders are bound by a Law and Canon,<note place="margin">In the Book of Canons publiſh'd by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>anno</hi> 1571. ch. of preach.</note> 
               <hi>Never to teach any thing to the people to be by them believed in matters of Religion, but what agrees with the Doctrine of the Old and New Teſtament, and what the Catholick Fathers and Ancient Prelates have gathered and inferred out of it: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder pain of Excommunication if they tranſgreſs, troubling the people with contrary Doctrine.</hi> It teacheth therefore, <hi>that in the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the body of Chriſt is given, taken and eaten; ſo that to the worthy Receivers, the conſecrated and broken bread is the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Artic. of Relig. 1562.</note> 
               <hi>and likewiſe the conſecrated Cup the communication of his bloud: But that the wicked, and they that approach unworthily the Sacrament of ſo ſacred a thing, eat and drink their own damnation, in that they become guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame Church in a ſolemn Prayer, before the conſecration prays thus; <hi>Grant us, gracious Lord, ſo to eat the fleſh of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt, and to drink his bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comm. Service.</note> 
               <hi>that our ſinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and our ſouls waſhed through his moſt precious bloud, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us.</hi> The Prieſt alſo, bleſſing or conſecrating the Bread and Wine ſaith thus, <hi>Hear us O merciful Father,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41401:14"/>we moſt humbly beſeech thee, and grant that we receiving theſe thy Creatures of Bread and Wine, according to thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt's holy inſtitution, in remembrance of his Death and Paſſion, may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed body and bloud: Who in the ſame night that he was betrayed took bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying take, eat, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is given for you, do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. Likewiſe after Supper he took the Cup; and when he had given thinks he gave it to them, ſaying, drink ye all of this, for this is my bloud of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for you, and for many for the remiſſion of ſins: Do this as oft as ye ſhall drink it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of we.</hi> The ſame, when he gives the Sacrament to the people kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giving the bread, ſaith; <hi>The body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was given for thee, preſerve thy body and ſoul unto everlaſting life.</hi> Likewiſe when he gives the Cup, he ſaith, <hi>The bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was ſhed for thee, preſerve thy body and ſoul to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Afterwards, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is done, follows a thankſgiving; <hi>Almighty and everliving God, we moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily thank thee, for that thou doſt vouchſafe to feed us, who have duly received theſe holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, with the ſpiritual food of the moſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41401:14"/>precious body and bloud of thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> With the Hymn, <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo in the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Catechiſm of our Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be learned of all, it is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the queſtion concerning the inward part of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Church Catech.</note> that <hi>it is the body and bloud of Chriſt which are verily and indeed taken and received by the Faithful in the Lords Supper.</hi> And in the Apology for this Church, writ by that worthy and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate <hi>Jewel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> it is expreſly affirmed, <hi>That to the faithful, is truly given in the Sacrament, the body and bloud of our Lord, the life-giving fleſh of the Son of God which quickens our ſouls, the bread that came from heaven, the food of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, grace and truth, and life: And that it is the Communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt, that we may abide in him, and he in us; and that we may be aſcertained that the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt is the food of our ſouls, as bread and wine is of our bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A while before the writing of this Apology, came forth the Dialectick of the famous Dr. <hi>Poinet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> concerning the truth, nature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body and bloud of Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament, writ on purpoſe to explain and manifeſt the Faith and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41401:15"/>Doctine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that point. In the firſt place it ſhews, <hi>that the holy Euchariſt is not only the figure, but alſo contains in it ſelf the truth, nature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body of our bleſſed Saviour; and that thoſe words, nature and ſubſtance ought not to be rejected, becauſe the Fathers uſed them in ſpeaking of that Myſtery.</hi> Secondly, He inquires whether thoſe expreſſions, truth, nature, and ſubſtance <hi>were uſed in this Myſtery by the Ancients, in their common acceptation, or in a ſenſe more particular and proper to the Sacraments? Becauſe we muſt not only obſerve what words they uſed, but alſo what they meant to ſignifie and to teach by them.</hi> And though with the Fathers he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a difference, betwixt the body of Chriſt in its natural form of a humane body, and that Myſtick body preſent in the Sacrament, yet he choſe rather to put that difference <hi>in the manner of preſence and exhibition,</hi> than <hi>in the ſubject it ſelf, that is, the real body and bloud of our Saviour;</hi> being it is moſt certain, that no other body is given to the faithful in the Sacrament than that which was by Chriſt given to death for their Redemption. Laſtly, he affirms, <hi>according to the unanimous conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that this matter muſt be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, baniſhing all groſſer and more carnal thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41401:15"/>
            <p n="5">5. To Biſhop <hi>Poinet</hi> ſucceeded in the ſame See the right Reverend Doctors <hi>T. Bilſon</hi> and <hi>L. Andrews,</hi> Prelates both of them, throughly learned, and great defenders of the Primitive Faith, who made it moſt evident by their Printed Writings, that the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in all things agreeable to the holy Scriptures, and the Divinity of the Ancient Fathers. And as to what regards this Myſtery, the<note n="a" place="margin">Bilſ. reſp. ad Card. Alan. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> firſt treats of it, in his Anſwer to the Apology of Cardinal <hi>Alan,</hi> and the<note n="b" place="margin">Andr. reſp. ad Apol Bel. c. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>11</hi>
               </note> laſt in his Anſwer to the Apology of Cardinal <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> where you may find things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be read and noted as follows. <hi>Chriſt ſaid, this is my body; in this, the object, we are agreed with you, the manner only is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. We hold by a firm belief that it is the body of Chriſt, of the manner how it comes to be ſo there is not a word in the Goſpel; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture is ſilent in this, we juſtly diſown it to be a matter of Faith: We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rank it among Tenets of the School, but by no means, among the Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Belief. We like well of what</hi> Durandus <hi>is reported to have ſaid, [We hear the Word, and feel the motion, we know not the manner, and yet believe the Preſence:] For we believe a Real Preſence no leſs than you do. We dare not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41401:16"/>be ſo bold as preſumptuouſly to define any thing concerning the manner of a true Preſence, or rather, we do not ſo much as trouble our ſelves with being inquiſitive about it; no more than in Baptiſm, how the bloud of Chriſt waſheth us; or in the Incarnation of our Redeemer, how the Divine and Humane Nature were united together. We put it in the number of ſacred things or Sacrifices, (the Euchariſt it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a, Sacred Myſtery), whereof the remnants ought to be conſumed with fire, that is, (as the Fathers elegantly have it) ador'd by faith) but not ſearcht by reaſon.</hi>

To theſe alſo we may juſtly add that famous Prelate <hi>Antonius de Domino Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Spalato,</hi> a man well verſed in the Sacred Writings, and the Records of Antiquity; who having left <hi>Italy</hi> (when he could no longer remain in it, either with quiet or ſafety) by the advice of his intimate Friend <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> took Sanctuary under the protection of King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory, in the boſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he did faithfully follow in all Points and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion: But being daily vex'd with many affronts and injuries, and wearied by the unjuſt perſecutions of ſome ſour and over-rigid men, who bitterly declaimed every where againſt his life and actions, he at laſt reſolved to return into <hi>Italy</hi> with a ſafe conduct. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed, he was, by order from the King, queſtioned by ſome Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated Biſhops what he thought of the Religion and Church of <hi>England,</hi> which for ſo many years he had owned and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what he would ſay of it in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court: to this Query he gave in writing this memorable anſwer, <hi>I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, even with the danger of my life, to profeſs before the Pope himſelf, that the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a true and Orthodox Church of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41401:17"/>Chriſt.</hi> This he not only promiſed but faithfully performed, for though, ſoon after his departure, there came a Book out of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> falſly bearing his name, by whoſe title many were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even among the Engliſh, and thereby moved to tax him with Apoſtacy, and of being another <hi>Eubolius;</hi> yet when he came to <hi>Rome</hi> (where he was moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained in the Palace of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Fifteenth,</hi> who formerly had been his Fellow-ſtudent) he could never be perſwaded by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and others who daily thronged upon him, neither to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the new deviſed-Tenets of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or to retract thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Books which he had Printed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> or to renounce the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe defence he conſtantly perſiſted to the very laſt. But preſently after the deceaſe of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> he was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> in <hi>Caſtle St. Angelo,</hi> where, by being barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly uſed, and almoſt ſtarved, he ſoon got a mortal ſickneſs, and died in a few days, though not without ſuſpicion of being poyſoned. The day following his Corps was, by the ſentence of the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> tyed to an infamous ſtake, and there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41401:17"/>burnt to aſhes; for no other reaſon, but that he refuſed to make abjuration of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſubſcribe ſome of the lately-made-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Trent,</hi> which were preſt upon him as Canons of the Catholick Faith. I have taken occaſion to inſert this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perhaps not known to many; to make it appear, that this Reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who did great ſervice to the Church of God, may juſtly (as I ſaid before) be reckoned amongſt the Writers of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us hear therefore what he taught and writ, when he was in <hi>England,</hi> in his Books <hi>de Repub. Eccl. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Num.</hi> 20. <hi>For a thouſand years together</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the holy Catholick church content with a ſober knowledge of Divine Myſteries, believed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and ſafely did teach, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment duly Conſecrated, the Faithful did own, receive, and eat the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which by the Sacred Bread and Wine are given to them, but as to the particular manner how that precious Body and Bloud is offered and given by that Myſterious Sacrament, the Church did humbly and religiouſly acknowledge her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: The real thing with its effects ſhe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully own'd and received, but meekly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly abſtained from inquiring into the manner.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41401:18"/>Item</hi> (Numb. 73.) <hi>the true and real Body of Chriſt is moſt certainly and undoubtedly given in the holy Sacrament, yet not carnally, but Spiritually.</hi> Again (Numb. 169.) <hi>I doubt not, but all they that believe the Goſpel, will acknowledge that in the holy Communion we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true nature of the fleſh of Chriſt, real and ſubſtantial. We all teach that the body of Chriſt is preſent as to its reality and nature, but a carnal and corporal manner of preſence we reject with St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And in <hi>Appen ad Ambroſium,</hi> Numb. 7. <hi>I know and acknowledge that with the Bread ſtill remaining bread, the true and real body of Chriſt is given, yet not corporally: I aſſent in the thing, but not in the manner. Therefore though there is a change in the Bread, when it brings into the Souls of worthy Communicants, the true body of Chriſt which is the ſubſtance of the Sacrament: Yet it doth not follow that the Bread loſeth its own, to become the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and much more to the ſame purpoſe, agreeable to the Religion and Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, you may find in the ſame Chapter, and in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe annext to the ſixth Book, againſt the famous <hi>Jeſuit, Suarez,</hi> who had writ againſt <hi>King James,</hi> and the Error (as he calls them) of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>

Hence they infer, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are, and are ſaid to be, with truth, the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt; not ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally indeed, that is, not corporally, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41401:23"/>and Myſtically, by vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; which conſiſteth not in a bare ſignification or obligation only, but alſo in a real exhibition and communication of both parts, earthly and heavenly, together at once, though in a different manner.</hi> 3. In that ſenſe they affirm with the Ancients, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are changed into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not in nature and ſubſtance, but in uſe and efficacy; in which reſpect the ſacred Elements are not called what they are to ſenſe, but what they are believed and received by faith grounded on the Promiſe.</hi> 4. They deny <hi>to believe the ſigns to be bare, inefficacious, and empty, but rather ſuch as truly give what they ſeal and ſignifie, being efficacious inſtruments and moſt certain means whereby the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and ſo, Chriſt himſelf with all his benefits, is ſet forth and offered to all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, but conferred and given to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and by them received as the ſaving and vivifying food of their Souls.</hi> 5.

Therefore if by the breaking of the bread our Saviour doth repreſent the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, it is not to be doubted but that he truly gives and confers it. If it be true that the viſible ſign is given us, to ſeal the gift of an inviſible thing, we muſt firmly believe, that

               <hi>We muſt therefore confeſs that the inward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sacrament is joyned with the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign, ſo that, as the Bread is put into our hand, the Body of Chriſt is alſo given to us. This certainly, if there were nothing elſe, ſhould abundantly ſatisfie us, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Chriſt, in his Holy Supper, gives us the true and proper ſubſtance of his Body and Bloud, that it being wholly ours, we may be made partakers of all his benefits and graces.</hi> Again, <hi>The Son of God offers daily to us in the holy Sacrament, the ſame body which he once offered in ſacrifice to his Father, that it may be our ſpiritual food.</hi> In theſe he aſſerts, as clearly as any one can, the true, <hi>Real,</hi> and ſubſtantial Preſence and Communication of the Body of Chriſt, but how, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes not to determine.<note place="margin">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41401:26"/>with <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> III. and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to determine the manner of the preſence and Manducation of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with more nicety than was fitting, he thereby fooliſhly overthrew all that he had wiſely ſaid before, denied what he had affirmed, and oppoſed his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>His fear was leſt his Adverſaries ſhould apply that word</hi> ſpiritually, <hi>not ſo much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the manner of preſence, as to exclude the very ſubſtance of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon that account it is not ſafe to uſe too muck that of St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>The body of Chriſt is not Corporally in the Sacrament, without adding preſently the above-mentioned explanation.</hi> How much do we comply with humane pride, and curioſity, which would ſeem to underſtand all things! Where is the danger? And what doth he fear, as long as all they that believe the Goſpel, own the true nature, &amp; the real and ſubſtantial preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, uſing that Explication of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> concerning the manner, which he himſelf, for the too great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth, durſt not but admit? And why doth he own that the manner is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, not carnal, and then require a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſence, as to the manner it ſelf? As for us, we all openly profeſs with St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41401:27"/>that the preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, is ſpiritual, and therefore; true and real; and with the ſame <hi>Bernard,</hi> and all the Ancients, we deny that the Body of Chriſt is carnally either preſent or given. The thing we willingly admit, but humbly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forbear to enquire into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We believe a Preſence and Union of Chriſt with our ſoul and body, which we know not how to call better than Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, that is, effected by eating; that while we eat and drink the conſecrated Bread and Wine, we eat and drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not in a corporal manner, but ſome other way, incomprehenſible, known only to God, which we call ſpiritual; for if with St. <hi>Bernard</hi> the Fathers a man goes no further, we do not find fault with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral explication of the manner, but with the preſumption and ſelf-conceitedneſs of thoſe who boldly and curiouſly inquire what is a ſpiritual preſence, as preſuming that they can underſtand the manner of acting of Gods holy Spirit. We contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe confeſs with the Fathers, that this manner of preſence is unaccountable, and paſt finding out, not to be ſearcht and
<pb facs="tcp:41401:27"/>pried into by Reaſon, but believed by Faith. And if it ſeems impoſſible that the fleſh of Chriſt ſhould deſcend, and come to be our food, through ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; we muſt remember how much the power of the holy Spirit exceeds our ſenſe and our apprehenſions, and how abſurd it would be to undertake to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Immenſity by our weakneſs and narrow capacity; and ſo make our Faith to conceive and believe what our Reaſon cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet our Faith doth not cauſe or make that Preſence, but apprehends it as moſt truly and really effected by the word of Chriſt: And the Faith whereby we are ſaid to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, is not that only whereby we believe that he died for our ſins (for this Faith is required and ſuppoſed to precede the Sacramental Manducation) but more properly, that whereby we believe thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body;</hi>

               </note> which was St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> meaning when he ſaid, <hi>Why doſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſtomach and thy teeth?

            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41401:28"/>
            <p n="5">5. The reſult of all this is, That the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt are Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to the Bread and Wine, ſo that Chriſt is truly given to the Faithful; and yet is not to be here conſidered with ſenſe or worldly reaſon, but by Faith, reſting on the words of the Goſpel. Now it is ſaid, that the Body and Bloud of Chriſt are joyned to the Bread and Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that in the celebration of the holy Euchariſt, the Fleſh is given together with the Bread, and the Bloud together with the Wine. All that remains is, That we ſhould with faith and humility admire this high and ſacred Myſtery, which our tongue cannot ſufficiently explain, nor our heart conceive.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. IT is an Article of faith in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in the Bleſſed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is reduced to nothing, and that in its place ſucceeds the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as we ſhall ſee more at large §6,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41401:29"/>and 7. The Proteſtants are much of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind; and yet none of them denies altogether but that there is a converſion of the Bread into the Body (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the Wine into the Bloud) of Chriſt: For they know and acknowledge that in the Sacrament, by vertue of the words and bleſſing of Chriſt, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uſe, and office of the Bread is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, that is, of common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, it becomes our Myſtical and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental food; whereby, as they affirm and believe, the true Body of Chriſt is not only ſhadowed and figured, but alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indeed, and by worthy Communicants truly received. Yet they believe not that the bread loſeth its own, to become the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body of Chriſt; for the holy Scripture, and the ancient Interpreters thereof for many ages, never taught ſuch an Eſſential change and converſion, as that the very ſubſtance, the matter and form of the Bread ſhould be wholly taken away, but only a myſterious and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental one, whereby our Ordinary is changed into Myſtick bread, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſigned and appointed to another uſe, end, and office than before? This change, whereby ſupernatural effects are wrought by things natural, while their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41401:29"/>Eſſence is preſerved entire, doth beſt agree with the grace and power of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no reaſon why we ſhould diſpute concerning Gods Omnipotency, whether it can do this or that, preſuming to meaſure an infinite power by our poor ability which is but weakneſs. We may grant that he is able to do beyond what we can think or apprehend, and reſolve his moſt wonderful acts into his abſolute will and power, but we may not charge him with working contradictions. And though Gods Almightineſs were able in this Myſtery to deſtroy the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, and eſſentially to change it into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, while the accidents of Bread and Wine ſubſiſt of themſelves without a ſubject, yet we deſire to have it proved that God will have it ſo, and that re is ſo indeed. For, that God doth it becauſe he can, is no Argument; and that he wills it, we have no other proof but the confident Aſſertion of our Adverſaries. <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxias</hi> declared, <hi>That we ſhould not conclude God doth things becauſe he is able, but that we ſhould enquire what he hath done;</hi> For God will never own that praiſe of his Omnipotency, whereby his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41401:30"/>and his truth are impaired, and thoſe things overthrown and deſtroy'd, which, in his word, he affirms to be; for, take away the Bread and Wine, and there remains no Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that ſay, that the matter and form of the Bread are wholly aboliſhed, yet will have the accidents to remain: But if the ſubſtance of the Bread be changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by vertue of his words, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the accidents of the Bread are not alſo changed into the accidents of Chriſts Body? They that urge the expreſs Letter, ſhould ſhew that Chriſt ſaid, This is the ſubſtance of my Body without its accidents. But he did not ſay, That he gave his Diſciples a Phantaſtick Body, ſuch a viſionary figment as <hi>Marcion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but that very Body which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us, without being deprived of that extention and other accidents of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies without which it could not have been crucified, ſince the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Tranſubſtantiation grant that the Body of Chriſt keeps its quantity in Heaven, and ſay it is without the ſame in the Sacrament; they muſt either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their contradiction in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or give over their opinion.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41401:30"/>
            <p n="4">4. Proteſtants dare not be ſo curious, or preſume to know more than is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Scripture and Antiquity, they firmly believing the words of Chriſt, make the form of this Sacrament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Union of the thing ſignified with the ſign, that is, the exhibition of the Body of Chriſt with the conſecrated bread, ſtill remaining bread; by divine appointment theſe two are made one; and though this Union be not natural, ſubſtantial, perſonal, or local by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one within another, yet it is ſo ſtraight and ſo true, that in eating the bleſſed Bread, the true body of Chriſt is given to us, and the names of the ſign and thing ſignified are reciprocally changed, what is proper to the body is attributed to the bread, and what belongs only to the bread, is affirmed of the body, and both are united in time, though not in place. For the preſence of Chriſt in this Myſtery is not oppoſed to diſtance but to abſence, which only could deprive us of the benefit and fruition of the object.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From what hath been ſaid it appears, that this whole controverſie may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to four Heads; 1. Concerning the Signs; 2. Concerning the thing ſignified;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41401:31"/>3. Concerning the Union of both; and 4. Concerning their participation; As for the firſt, The Proteſtants differ from the Papiſts in this, that according to the nature of Sacraments, and the Doctrine of holy Scripture we make the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, and they acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents only to be ſigns. In the ſecond, they not underſtanding our opinion do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent it, for we do not hold (as they ſay we do) that only the merits of the Death of Chriſt are repreſented by the bleſſed Elements, but alſo that his very Body which was crucified, and his Bloud which was ſhed for us, are truly ſignified and offered, that our Souls may receive and poſſeſs Chriſt, as truly and certainly as the material and viſible ſigns are by us ſeen and received. And ſo in the third place, becauſe the thing ſignified is offered and given to us, as truly as the ſign it ſelf, in this reſpect we own the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Body and bloud of Chriſt, and the Elements, whoſe uſe and office we hold to be changed from what it was before. But we deny what the Papiſts affirm, that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine are quite aboliſhed, and changed into the Body and Bloud of our Lord in ſuch ſort, that the bare accidents
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41401:31"/>of the Elements do alone remain united with Chriſts Body and Bloud. And we alſo deny that the Elements ſtill retain the nature of Sacraments when not uſed according to divine inſtitution, that is, given by Chriſts Miniſters, and received by his People; ſo that Chriſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread ought not, cannot be kept and preſerved to be carried about, becauſe he is preſent only to the Communicants. As for the fourth and laſt point, we do not ſay, that in the Lords Supper we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive only the benefits of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, but we joyn the ground with its fruits, that is, Chriſt with thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we receive from him, affirming with St. <hi>Paul, That the bread which we break is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>the Communion of the body of Chriſt, and the Cup which we bleſs, the Communion of his bloud;</hi> of that very ſubſtance which he took of the bleſſed Virgin, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried into heaven; differing from thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> only in this, that they will have our Union with Chriſt to be corporal, and our eating of him likewife, and we on the contrary maintain it to be, indeed as true, but not carnal or natural. And as he that receives unworthily, (that is, with the mouth only, but not with a faithful heart) eats and drinks his own
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41401:32"/>damnation, ſo he that doth it worthily, receives his Abſolution and Juſtification; that is, he that <hi>diſcerns,</hi> and then receives the Lords Body as torn, and his Bloud as ſhed for the redemption of the world. But that Chriſt (as the Papiſts affirm) ſhould give his fleſh and bloud to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the mouth, and ground with the teeth, ſo that not only the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Infidels, but even Rats and Mice ſhould ſwallow him down, this our words and our hearts do utterly deny.</p>
            <p n="6">6. So then, (to ſum up this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie by applying to it all that hath been ſaid) It is not queſtioned whether the Body of Chriſt be abſent from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment duly adminiſtred according to his Inſtitution, which we Proteſtants neither affirm nor believe: For it being given and received in the Communion, it muſt needs be that it is preſent, though in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner veiled under the Sacrament, ſo that of it ſelf it cannot be ſeen. Neither is it doubted or diſputed whether the Bread and Wine, by the power of God and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural vertue, be ſet apart and fitted for a much nobler uſe, and raiſed to a higher dignity than their nature bears; for we confeſs the neceſſity of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and heavenly change, and that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41401:32"/>the ſigns cannot become Sacraments but by the infinite power of God, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right it is to inſtitute Sacraments in his Church, being able alone to endue them with vertue and efficacy. Finally, we do not ſay that our bleſſed Saviour gave only the figure and ſign of his body; neither do we deny a Sacramental Union of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt with the ſacred Bread and Wine, ſo that both are really and ſubſtantially received together: But (that we may avoid all ambiguity) we deny that after the words and prayer of Conſecration, the bread ſhould remain bread no longer, but ſhould be changed into the ſubſtance of the Body of Chriſt, nothing of the Bread but only the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents continuing to be what they were before: And ſo the whole queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Tranſubſtantiation of the outward Elements; whether the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread be turned into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Bloud; or as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Tranſubſtantiation, whether the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine doth utterly periſh, and the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Bloud ſucceed in their place, which are both denied by Proteſtants.</p>

               <hi>The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church ever taught, that by the converſion of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt (which converſion hath been in after times called Tranſubſtantiation) it comes to paſs,

And though God by his Almightineſs be able to turn the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread into ſome other ſubſtance, yet none will believe that he doth it, as long as it appears to our ſenſes, that the ſubſtance of the Bread doth ſtill remain whole and entire.

               <p>That neither the word nor name of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, nor the Doctrine or the thing it ſelf is taught or contained in holy Scripture, or in the Writings of the ancient Doctors of the Church, but rather is contrary to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of Faith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THe word Tranſubſtantiation is ſo far from being found either in the ſacred Records, or in the Monuments of the ancient Fathers, that the maintainers of it do themſelves acknowledge that it was not ſo much as heard of before the twelfth Century. For though one <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autun,</hi> be ſaid to have once uſed it, yet it is without proof that ſome Modern Writers make him one of the tenth Century; nor yet doth he ſay, that the bread is Tranſubſtantiated, <hi>but as it were</hi> Tranſubſtantiated, which<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3 <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>art.</hi> 5, and this <hi>ch. art.</hi> 5.</note> well underſtood might be admitted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, that the thing it ſelf without the word, that the Doctrine without the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41401:36"/>expreſſion cannot be found in Scripture, is ingeniouſly acknowledged by the moſt learned Schoolmen <hi>Scotus, Durandus, Biel, Cameracenſis, Cajetan,</hi> and many more, who finding it not, brought in by the Popes Authority, and received in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, till 1200 years after Chriſt, yet endeavoured to defend it by other Arguments.</p>

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf doth ſay, <hi>That though he might bring Scripture clear enough, to his thinking, to prove Tranſubſtantiation by, to an eaſie man, yet ſtill it would be doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had done it to purpoſe, becauſe ſome very acute and learned men, as</hi> Scotus, <hi>hold that it cannot be proved by Scripture.</hi> Now in this, Proteſtants deſire no more but to be of the opinion of thoſe learned and acute men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And indeed, the words of inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would plainly make it appear to any man that would prefer truth to wrangling, that it is with the Bread, that the Lords Body is given, (as his Bloud with the Wine) for Chriſt, having taken, bleſſed, and broken the bread, ſaid, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than whom none could better underſtand the meaning of Chriſt, explains it thus, <hi>The bread which we break is the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Communion or communication of the body of Chriſt,</hi> that whereby his body is given, and the Faithful are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it. That it was bread which he reacht to them, there was no need of any proof, the receiver's ſenſes ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd them of it; but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41401:37"/>his body was given, none could have known, had it not been declared by him who is the truth it ſelf. And though, by the divine inſtitution and the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle every faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant may be as certainly aſſured that he receives the Lords Body, as if he knew that the Bread is ſubſtantially turned into it, yet it doth not therefore follow, that the Bread is ſo changed, that its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is quite done away, ſo that there remains nothing preſent, but the very natural Body of Chriſt, made of bread: For certain it is, that the bread is not the Body of Chriſt any otherwiſe than as the Cup is the New Teſtament, and two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſequences cannot be drawn from thoſe two not different expreſſions. Therefore as the Cup cannot be the New Teſtament but by a Sacramental figure, no more can the Bread be the Body of Chriſt, but in the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other ſay, That it is not poſſible the words of Chriſt can be true, but by that converſion, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is ſo far from being ſo, that if it were admitted, it would firſt deny the Divine Omnipotency, as though God were not able to make the Body of Chriſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41401:38"/>preſent, and truly to give it in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt the ſubſtance of the Bread remains. 2. It would be inconſiſtent with the Divine Benediction which preſerves things in their proper being. 3. It would be contrary to the true nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which always conſiſteth of two parts. And laſtly, It would in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtroy the true ſubſtance of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt, which cannot be ſaid to be made of Bread and Wine by a Prieſt, without a moſt high preſumption. But the truth of the words of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains conſtant, and can be defended, without overthrowing ſo many other great truths. Suppoſe a Teſtator puts Deeds and Titles in the hand of his Heir, with theſe words, Take the Houſe which I bequeath thee; There is no man will think that thoſe Writings and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are that very Houſe which is made of Wood or Stones, and yet no man will ſay that the Teſtator ſpake falſly or obſcurely. Likewiſe our bleſſed Saviour, having ſanctified the Elements by his words and prayers, gave them to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples as Seals of the New Teſtament, whereby they were as certainly ſecured of thoſe rich and precious Legacies which he left to them, as Children are of their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41401:38"/>Fathers Lands and Inheritance, by Deeds and Inſtruments ſigned and delivered for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To the Sacred Records we may add the judgment of the Primitive Church. For thoſe Orthodox and holy Doctors of our holier Religion, thoſe great Lights of the Catholick Church, do all clearly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and unanimouſly conſpire in this, That the preſence of the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament is only myſtick and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. As for the entire annihilation of the ſubſtance of the Bread and the Wine, or that new and ſtrange Tenet of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, they did not ſo much as hear or ſpeak any thing of it: Nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtream of their Doctrine doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run againſt it, how great ſoever are the brags and pretences of the Papiſts to the contrary. And if you will hear them one by one, I ſhall bring ſome of their moſt noted paſſages only, that our labour may not be endleſs by rehearſing all that they have ſaid to our purpoſe on this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall begin with that holy and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctor, <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. An. Dom. <hi>144.</hi>
               </note> who is one of the firſt after the Apoſtles times, whoſe undoubted Writings are come to us. What was believed at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere in his time, concerning this holy myſtery,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41401:39"/>may well be underſtood out of theſe his words: <hi>After that the Biſhop hath prayed, and bleſſed, and the people ſaid Amen, thoſe whom we call Deacons or Miniſters give to every one of them that are preſent a portion of the Bread and Wine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apol. <hi>2.</hi> ad Anton. prope fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
               <hi>and that food we call the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, for we do not receive it as ordinary Bread and Wine.</hi> They received it as bread, yet not as common bread. And a little after, <hi>By this food digeſted, our fleſh and bloud are fed, and we are taught that it is the Body and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the ſubſtance of the Bread remains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains corruptible food, even after the Conſecration, which can in no wiſe be ſaid of the immortal Body of Chriſt: For the fleſh of Chriſt is not turned into our fleſh, neither doth it nouriſh it, as doth that food which is Sacramentally called the Fleſh of Chriſt. But the Fleſh of Chriſt feeds our ſouls unto eternal life.</p>
            <p n="8">8. After the ſame manner, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by that holy Martyr <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop much about the ſame time.<note place="margin">St. Iren. A.D. <hi>160.</hi>
               </note>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41401:39"/>
               <hi>As the grain of wheat falling in the ground, and dying, riſeth again much increaſed, and then receiving the word of God becomes the Euchariſt</hi> (which is the Body and Bloud of Chriſt;)<note place="margin">

               <hi>but it is he himſelf that gives it, he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appointed that Cup which is a Creature, and his Bloud alſo, and that Bread which is a Creature, and alſo his Body. And ſo when the Bread and the Cup are bleſſed by Gods Word, they become the Euchariſt of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and from them our bodied receive nouriſhment and increaſe.</hi> Now that our fleſh is fed and encreaſed by the natural body of Chriſt cannot be ſaid without great impiety by themſelves that hold Tranſubſtantiation. For naturally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nouriſheth our bodies but what is made fleſh and bloud by the laſt digeſtion, which it would be blaſphemous to ſay of the incorruptible body of Chriſt. Yet the ſacred Elements which in ſome mannner are, and are ſaid to be the body and bloud of Chriſt, yield nouriſhment and encreaſe to our bodies by their earthly nature, in ſuch ſort, that by vertue alſo of the heavenly and ſpiritual food which the faithful receive by means of the material,

The figure of the Body of Chriſt proves it to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for there can be no figure of a Ghoſt or a Phantaſm. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt having taken the Bread, and given it to his Diſciples made it his Body by ſaying, This is my Body, that is, the figure of my Body. Now, it could not have been a figure except the body were real, for a meer appearance, an imaginary Phantaſm is not capable of a figure.</hi> Each part of this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41401:40"/>Argument is true, and contains a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Concluſion. For 1.

Laſtly, The realty of the Body is proved by that of its figure, and ſo if you deny the ſubſtance of the bread (as the Papiſts do) you thereby deſtroy the truth and realty of the Body of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

               <hi>it is bread indeed before the bleſſing of the Sacrament, but when it is conſecrated it becomes the Body of Chriſt. This we are therefore to declare, how can that which is bread be alſo the body of Chriſt? By Conſecration. And Conſecration is made by the words of our Lord, that the venerable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be perfected. You ſee how efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the word of Chriſt. If there be then ſo great a power in the word of Chriſt to make the Bread and Wine to be what they were not, how much greater is that power, which ſtill preſerves them to be what they were, and yet makes them to be what they were not? Therefore, that I may anſwer thee, it was not the Body of Chriſt before the Conſecration, but now after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, it is the Body of Chriſt; he ſaid the word and it was done; thou thy ſelf wert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but wert an old Creature; after thou haſt been conſecrated in Baptiſm thou art become a new creature.</hi> By theſe words St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> teacheth how we are to underſtand that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, to wit, by ſuch a change that the Bread and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41401:45"/>Wine do not ceaſe to be what they were as to their ſubſtance (for then they ſhould not be what they were) and yet by the Bleſſing become what before they were not. For ſo they are ſaid to remain (as indeed they do) what they were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that yet they are changed by grace, that is, they become aſſured Sacraments of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and by that means certain pledges of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption.

Or did Chriſt ſay concerning the accidents of the Bread and Wine, theſe accidents
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41401:48"/>are, or this accident is my body? But (though we have not that liberty, yet) the Inventors of Tranſubſtantiation may when they pleaſe make a Creator of a Creature, ſubſtances of accidents, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of ſubſtances, and any thing out of any thing. But ſure they are too immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and uncharitable, who, to elude the authority of ſo famous and ſo worthy a Father as <hi>Theodoret,</hi> alledge that he was accuſed of ſome errours in the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though he repented afterwards, as they themſelves are forced to confeſs. Fain would they if they could get out at this door, when they cannot deny that he affirmed, that the Elements remain in their natural ſubſtance, as he wrote in the Dialogues which he compoſed againſt the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereticks, with the applauſe and approbation of the Catholick Church. And indeed the evidence of this truth hath compelled ſome of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to yield that <hi>Theodoret</hi> is of our ſide. For in the Epiſtle before the Dialogues of <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition, ſet forth by <hi>Stephen Nicolinus,</hi> the Popes Printer, in the year 1547, it is plainly ſet down.<note place="margin">Praef. in Dial.

But he hath many things repugnant to Tranſubſtantiation, which (as I have ſaid) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf had not yet quite found out. I ſhall mention a few of them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>left us this Sacrament, a viſible figure and character of his Body and Bloud, that by them our Spirit might the better embrace ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and inviſible things, and be more fully fed by Faith.</hi> Again, <hi>We muſt receive our ſpiritual Sacraments with the mouth of the Soul, and the taſte of Faith.</hi> Item. <hi>Whilſt therein we ſavour nothing carnal, but we being ſpiritual, and underſtanding the whole ſpiritually, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Chriſt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are received ſpiritually.</hi> And again, <hi>To ſavour according to the fleſh, is death; and yet to receive ſpiritually the true Fleſh of Chriſt, is life eternal.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>The Fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are not received car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but ſpiritually.</hi> In theſe he teacheth, that the Myſtery of the Lords Supper is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41401:53"/>not, and ought not to be underſtood car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally but ſpiritually, and that this dream of corporal and oral Tranſubſtantiation was unknown to the Ancient Church. As for what hath been added to this Book, by the craft (without doubt) of ſome ſuperſtitious forgerer, (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> complains that it too frequently happens to the Writing of the Ancients,) it is Fabulous, as the viſible appearing of the Body of Chriſt in the form of an Infant with fingers of raw fleſh; ſuch ſtuff is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be Fathered on <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> who profeſt that he delivered no other Doctrin concerning the Sacrament, than that which he had learned out of the Ancient Fathers, and not from idle and uncertain ſtories of Miracles.</p>

For when men began to be diſturbed at the Book of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> ſome ſaying one thing, and ſome another, the Emperour being moved by their diſputes propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf two queſtions to <hi>Bertram.</hi> 1. Whether, what the Faithful eat in the Church, be made the Body and Bloud of Chriſt in Figure and in Myſtery? 2. Or whether that natural body which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which ſuffered, died, and was buried, and now ſitteth on the right hand of God the Father, be it ſelf dayly received by the mouth of the Faithful in the Myſtery of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The firſt of theſe <hi>Bertram</hi> reſolved Affirmatively, the ſecond Negatively, and ſaid, that there was as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41401:55"/>betwixt thoſe two bodies, as betwixt the earneſt and that whereof it is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. <hi>It is evident</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that that Bread and Wine are figuratively the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi>

               </note> — <hi>According to the ſubſtance of the Elements, they are after the Conſecration what they were before. — For the Bread is not Chriſt ſubſtantially. — If this myſtery be not done in a figure, it cannot well be called a Myſtery. — The Wine alſo which is made the Sacrament of the Bloud of Chriſt by the Conſecration of the Prieſt, ſhews one thing by its outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and contains another inwardly. For what is there viſible in its outſide but only the ſubſtance of the Wine? Theſe things are changed, but not according to the material part, and by this change they are not what they truly appear to be, but are ſome thing elſe beſides what is their proper being: For they are made ſpiritually the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; not that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be two different things, but in one reſpect they are, as they appear, Bread and Wine, and in another the Body and Bloud of Chriſt. — Hence, according to the viſible Creature they feed the body, but according to the vertue of a more excellent ſubſtance they nouriſh and ſanctifie the ſouls of the Faithful.</hi> Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought many Teſtimonies of holy Scripture and the ancient Fathers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, he at laſt prevents that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny

               <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullo.</hi> Out of all theſe appears moſt certain, that the infection of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation was not yet ſpread over the Chriſtian world; but that the ſound Doctrine of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and of their true, (yet ſpiritual not carnal) Preſence in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, with the Elements, ſtill the ſame in ſubſtance after Conſecration, was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where owned and maintained. And though the Fathers uſed both ways of ſpeaking (that is, that the Bread and Wine are the true Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and that their ſubſtance ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they are Signs, Types, Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, and Pledges of them; Images, Figures, Similitudes, Repreſentations, and Samplers of them,) yet there was no cantrariety or diverſity in the ſenſe. For they were not ſo Faithleſs as to believe that theſe are only naturall Elements, or bare Signs; and they were not of ſo groſs and ſo dull an apprehenſion, as not to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41401:60"/>diſtinguiſh betwixt the Sacramental and Myſtick, and the carnal and natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, as it is now maintained by the Patrons of Tranſubſtantiation. For in this they underſtood no other change than that which is common to all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the outward natural part is ſaid to be changed into the inward and divine, only becauſe it repreſents it truly and efficaciouſly, and makes all worthy Receivers partakers thereof; and becauſe by the vertue of the Holy Spirit, and of Chriſt's holy inſtitution, the Elements obtain thoſe divine Excellencies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, which they cannot have of their own nature. And this is it which was taught and believed, for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together, by pious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antiquity, concerning this moſt holy Myſtery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are alſo ſome other things whereby we may underſtand that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not belief <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or that the preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is ſo inſeparably tyed to the accidents of Bread and Wine, that Chriſt muſt needs be preſent as long as thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents retain any reſemblance of Bread and Wine, even when they are not put to that uſe appointed by divine inſtitution.

            <p n="3">3. But yet at laſt, let us ſee what props theſe new builders pretend to borrow from Antiquity to uphold their Caſtle in the air, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> They uſe indeed to ſcrape together many Teſtimonies of the Fathers of the firſt and middle age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would fain prove, that thoſe Fathers believed and taught the <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the natural Body and Bloud of Chriſt, juſt as the Roman Church, at this day, doth teach and believe. We will therefore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41401:61"/>briefly examine them, that it may yet more fully appear that Antiquity and all Fathers did not in the leaſt favour the new Tenet of Tranſubſtantiation; but that, that true Doctrin which I have ſet down in the begining of this book, was conſtantly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſerved in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now, almoſt all that they produce out of the Fathers will be conveniently reduced to certain heads, that we may not be too tedious in anſwering each teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by it ſelf.</p>

For no body can deny, but that the things that are ſeen are ſigns and figures, and thoſe that are not ſeen, the Body and Bloud of Chriſt: And that therefore the nature of this myſtery is ſuch, that when we receive
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41401:62"/>the Bread and Wine, we alſo together with them receive at the ſame time the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt, which in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the holy Euchariſt, are as truly given as they are repreſented. Hence came into the Church this manner of ſpeaking, the Conſecrated Bread is Chriſts Body.</p>

               </note> to what is brought out of the Fathers, concerning the converſion, change, tranſmutation, transfiguration, and tranſelementation of the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, (wherein the Papiſts do greatly glory, boaſting of the conſent of Antiquity with them;) I anſwer that there is no ſuch conſequence, Tranſubſtantiation being another ſpecies of change, the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not full, for it doth not follow, that becauſe there is a converſion, a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, a tranſelementation, there ſhould be alſo a Tranſubſtantiation; which the Fathers never ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. For becauſe this is a Sacrament, the change muſt be underſtood to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental alſo, whereby common Bread and Wine become the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which could not be did not the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remain, for a Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of two-parts, an earthly and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. And ſo becauſe ordinary Bread is changed by conſecration into a Bread which is no more of common uſe, but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41401:63"/>appointed by divine inſtitution to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſign whereby is repreſented the Body of Chriſt, in whom dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby dignified, having great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies ſuperadded, and ſo made what it was not before, it is therefore ſaid by ſome of the Fathers to be changed, to be made another thing. And truly that change is great and ſupernatural, but yet not ſubſtantial, not of a ſubſtance which ſubſtantially ceaſeth to be, into another ſubſtance which ſubſtantially beginneth to be, but it is a change of ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which alters not the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Element. This is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Scripture, which uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and repreſents the converſion of men, and the ſupernatural change of things, as though it were natural, though it be not ſo. So thoſe that are renewed by the Word, and Spirit, and Faith of Chriſt, are ſaid to be<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 3.3. 1 Pet. 1.3. 1 Cor. 4.15. Rom. 12.3. Eph. 4.22 Gal. 6.15.</note> regenerated, converted, and transformed, to put off the old man, and put on the new man, and to be new Creatures; but they are not ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another ſubſtance, to be tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated: For men thus converted have ſtill the ſame humane body, and the ſame rational ſoul as before, though in a far
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41401:63"/>better ſtate and condition, as every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will acknowledge. Nay, the Fathers themſelves uſe thoſe words, Tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Transformation, Tranſelementati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon other occaſions, when they ſpeak of things whoſe ſubſtance is neither loſt nor changed. For thoſe words be of ſo large a ſignification, that though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſubſtantial change is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them, yet for the moſt part they ſignifie only a moral change, a change of qualities, of condition, of office, of uſe, and the like.

               <hi>not only that we are made Chriſtians, but alſo made Chriſt.</hi> Laſtly, ſuch is that of B. <hi>Leo, In that myſtical diſtribution, it is given us to be made his fleſh.</hi> Certainly, if any man would wrangle and take advantage of theſe, he might thereby maintain, as well that we are <hi>Tranſubſtantiated</hi> into Chriſt, and Chriſts fleſh into the Bread, as that the Bread and Wine are <hi>Tranſubſtantiated</hi> into his Body and Bloud. But Proteſtants who ſcorn to play the Sophiſters, interpret theſe and the like paſſages of the Fathers, with candour and ingenuity, (as it is moſt fitting they ſhould.) For the expreſſions of Preachers, which often have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Paradox, muſt not be taken according to that harſher ſound where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they at firſt ſtrike the Auditors ears; the Fathers ſpake not of any Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated bread, but of the myſtical and conſecrated, when they uſed thoſe ſorts of expreſſions; and that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 1. That they might extoll and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the dignity of this Myſtery, which all true Chriſtians acknowledge to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41401:66"/>very great and peerleſs. 2. That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants might not reſt in the outward Elements, but ſeriouſly conſider the thing repreſented, whereof they are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made partakers, if they be worthy Receivers. 3. And laſtly, That they might approach ſo great a Myſtery with the more zeal, reverence, and devotion. And that thoſe Hyperbolick expreſſions are thus to be underſtood, the Fathers themſelves teach clearly enough, when they come to interpret them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Laſtly, Being the ſame holy Fathers who (as the manner is to diſcourſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) ſpeak ſometimes of the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, as if they were the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, do alſo very often call them Types, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Signs, the Figure of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; from hence it appears moſt manifeſtly that they were of the Proteſtants, and not of the Papiſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For we can without prejudice to what we believe of the Sacrament, uſe thoſe former expreſſions which the Papiſts believe, do moſt favour them, if they be underſtood, as they ought to be, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. But the latter none can uſe, but he muſt thereby overthrow the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; theſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41401:66"/>two, the Bread is Tranſubſtantiated into the Body, and the Bread alſo is the Type, the Sign, the Figure of the body of Chriſt being wholly inconſiſtent. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a thing that loſeth its being ſhould yet be the ſign and repreſentation of another; neither can any thing be the Type and the Sign of it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But if without admitting of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſenſe the words be uſed too rigorouſly, nothing but this will follow, that the Bread and Wine are really and properly the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which they themſelves diſown, that hold Tranſubſtantiation. Therefore in this change, it is not a newneſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but of uſe and vertue that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; which yet the Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with us, to be wonderful, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and proper only to Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency: For that earthly and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible meat cannot become to us a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and heavenly, the Communion of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, without Gods eſpecial power and operation. And whereas it is far above Philoſophy and Humane Reaſon, that Chriſt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (where alone he is locally) ſhould reach down to us the divine vertue of his; Fleſh, ſo that we are made one body with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41401:67"/>him; therefore it is as neceſſary as it is reaſonable, that the Fathers ſhould tell us, that we ought with ſingleneſs of heart to believe the Son of God, when he ſaith, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and that we ought not to meaſure this high and holy Myſtery by our narrow conceptions, or by the courſe of nature. For it is more acceptable to God with an humble ſimplicity of faith to reverence and embrace the words of Chriſt, than to wreſt them violently to a ſtrange and improper ſenſe, and with curioſity and preſumption to determine what exceeds the capacity of Men and Angels. Thus much in general may ſuffice to anſwer thoſe places of the Fathers, which are uſually brought in the behalf of Tranſubſtantiation.

As for what he calls the Appearances of Bread and Wine, he doth not thereby exclude, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their ſubſtance, and mean the Bread and Wine it ſelf: For ſo he intimates by what there follows; <hi>Do not look on them as bare Bread and Wine;</hi> as much as to ſay, it is bread indeed, but yet not bare bread, but ſomething beſides. But that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Water into Wine makes nothing for Tranſubſtantiation, may be thus made to appear. That Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency can change one ſubſtance into another, none will deny, and we ſee it done by Chriſt in the Town of <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> when he changed the Water into Wine; and it was a true and proper Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41401:69"/>Lords Supper tell us of quite another change, which, if well conſidered, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as be underſtood. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread is not changed into another that had no being, but, as they ſay, the bread is changed into that body of Chriſt which really exiſted and had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe many hundred years, ever ſince the Incarnation: Whereas that very Wine which Chriſt made of the Water, was not in being before the change which he wrought. Now it is eaſie for any to underſtand, that he who created all things out of nothing, can well make a new Wine of Water, or any other thing; but it is more than abſurd, that the body of Chriſt, or any other ſubſtance already in being, perfect and complete, ſhould be made a freſh of another ſubſtance, when it really ſubſiſted before. Which they well underſtood who deviſed an adduction, or bringing of the Body of Chriſt into the place of the Bread, and that is as much as to deny Tranſubſtantiation; except it can be ſaid that a man is Tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, as often as he comes into his place, which no man in his right wits can fancy.</p>

He adds, <hi>That Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou receiveſt is made by the word of Chriſt; and if the word of</hi> Elias <hi>had ſo much power as to bring down fire from heaven, ſhall not the words of Chriſt be efficacious enough to change the properties of the Elements?

Again, <hi>There are two parts in the Sacrifice of the Church</hi> (this is according to St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) <hi>the viſible Sacrament, and the inviſible thing of the Sacrament, that is, the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Item, <hi>The Bread and Wine which are Conſecrated, remain in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, having a reſemblance with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are a Sacrament, for elſe they could not be a Sacrament.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Sacraments are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Signs of divine things, but in them the inviſible things are honoured.</hi> All this agrees well with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Fathers above cited.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41401:79"/>without any relation, but Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein by the gift of a viſible ſign, an inviſible and divine grace with the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is given, he ſaith; <hi>That the viſible Sign is as a Ring, which is given not for it ſelf or abſolutely, but to inveſt and give poſſeſſion of an Eſtate made over to one. Many things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are done for their own ſake, and many in reference to ſomething elſe, and then they are called Signs. A Ring is given abſolutely as a gift, and then it hath no other meaning; it is alſo given to make good an Inveſtiture or Contract, and then it is a Sign: So that he that receives it may ſay, The Ring is not worth much, it is what it ſignifies, the Inheritance I value. In this manner when the Paſſion of our Lord drew nigh, he took care that his Diſciples might be inveſted with his grace, that his inviſible grace might be aſſured and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them by a viſible ſign. To this end all Sacraments are inſtituted, and to this the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Euchariſt is appointed.</hi> Now, as no man can fancy that the Ring is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially changed into the Inheritance, whether Lands or Houſes, none alſo can ſay with truth, or without abſurdity, that the Bread and Wine are ſubſtantially changed into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt. But in his Sermon on the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which none doubts to be his,<note place="margin">Serm. de Purif. B. Mariae.</note> he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41401:80"/>ſpeaks yet more plain; <hi>The Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament is the food of the ſoul, not of the belly, therefore we eat him not corporally; but in the manner that Chriſt is meat, in the ſame manner we underſtand that he is eaten.</hi> Alſo in his Sermon on St. <hi>Martin,</hi>
